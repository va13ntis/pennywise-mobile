# Kaching Sound Feature

This document describes the "kaching" sound feature that plays when a new expense is added to the PennyWise app.

## Overview

When a user successfully adds a new expense, the app plays a pleasant "kaching" sound to provide positive feedback and make the experience more engaging.

## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified

1. **SoundManager.kt** - New utility class for managing app sounds
   - Location: `app/src/main/java/com/pennywise/app/presentation/util/SoundManager.kt`
   - Handles sound pool initialization and sound playback
   - Uses Android's SoundPool for efficient sound management

2. **AddExpenseViewModel.kt** - Modified to integrate sound playing
   - Added SoundManager dependency injection
   - Plays kaching sound on successful expense save

3. **Raw Resources** - Sound file storage
   - Location: `app/src/main/res/raw/`
   - Contains the kaching sound file (when added)

### How It Works

1. When the user taps "Save" on the Add Expense screen
2. The AddExpenseViewModel processes the expense data
3. If the save is successful, the ViewModel sets the UI state to Success
4. The SoundManager plays the kaching sound
5. The user hears the sound and sees the success feedback

### Sound File Requirements

- **File name**: `kaching.mp3` (or `.ogg`, `.wav`)
- **Location**: `app/src/main/res/raw/kaching.mp3`
- **Duration**: 1-2 seconds recommended
- **File size**: Under 100KB recommended
- **Format**: MP3, OGG, or WAV
- **Content**: Pleasant "kaching" or cash register sound

### Adding the Sound File

1. Download or create a kaching sound effect
2. Name it `kaching.mp3` (or appropriate extension)
3. Place it in `app/src/main/res/raw/`
4. In `SoundManager.kt`, uncomment the sound loading code (lines 45-55)
5. Add the import: `import com.pennywise.app.R`
6. Build and test the app

### Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- If the sound file is missing, the app continues to work without sound
- Sound loading failures are logged but don't crash the app
- Sound playback failures are handled gracefully
- The expense saving functionality is not affected by sound issues

### Testing

To test the feature:

1. Add a kaching sound file to the raw resources
2. Build and run the app
3. Navigate to Add Expense screen
4. Fill out the form and tap Save
5. Verify that the kaching sound plays on successful save

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the sound feature:

- Add settings to enable/disable sounds
- Support for different sound themes
- Volume control for app sounds
- Haptic feedback integration
- Sound for other actions (delete, edit, etc.)

## Dependencies

- Android SoundPool API
- Hilt dependency injection
- No external audio libraries required

## Compatibility

- Works on Android API 21+ (Android 5.0+)
- Compatible with all supported Android versions in the app
- No additional permissions required

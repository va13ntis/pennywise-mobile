# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update Expense Form with Currency Selection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the expense form to pre-select the user's default currency and allow currency changes via dropdown.
# Details:
Modify the expense form to include a currency selection dropdown that pre-selects the user's default currency. The dropdown should allow changing the currency for individual expenses and show the currency symbol next to the amount field.

Implementation details:
1. Use MaterialComponents Exposed Dropdown Menu for currency selection
2. Pre-select the user's default currency
3. Show currency symbol next to amount field
4. Update amount formatting based on selected currency
5. Maintain currency selection for the session
6. Use the same CurrencyAdapter as in the registration screen

Code example for updating the amount field based on currency:
```kotlin
private fun updateAmountFieldForCurrency(currency: Currency) {
    // Update hint with currency symbol
    binding.amountInputLayout.prefixText = currency.symbol
    
    // Update formatting based on currency
    val decimalDigits = when(currency.code) {
        "JPY" -> 0
        else -> 2
    }
    
    // Set up input filter for decimal places
    binding.amountEditText.filters = arrayOf(DecimalDigitsInputFilter(decimalDigits))
}
```

Use ViewBinding for cleaner view access and ViewModel to maintain state during configuration changes. Implement proper validation for amount based on currency (e.g., JPY doesn't use decimal places).

# Test Strategy:
Write UI tests using Espresso to verify that:
1. User's default currency is pre-selected
2. Currency can be changed via dropdown
3. Currency symbol is displayed correctly next to amount
4. Amount formatting updates based on selected currency
5. Selected currency is saved with the transaction
6. Currency selection is maintained during the session
7. Accessibility testing with TalkBack
8. Test with different currencies and amount formats

Successfully implemented amount field currency formatting:

1. **Enhanced Amount Field**:
   - Added currency symbol as prefix to the amount field
   - Implemented currency-specific formatting based on decimal places
   - Added supporting text showing currency name and decimal places
   - Applied real-time formatting as user types

2. **Currency-Specific Formatting Logic**:
   - For currencies with 0 decimal places (JPY, KRW): Only allows digits, no decimal point
   - For other currencies: Limits decimal places based on currency.decimalPlaces
   - Real-time validation and formatting as user types

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Currency symbol displayed as prefix in the amount field
   - Supporting text shows currency name and decimal places for guidance
   - Maintains proper Material Design 3 styling

The amount field now properly displays the currency symbol and enforces currency-specific formatting rules in real-time.

## 4. Add validation for currency-specific amount formats [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement proper validation for amount based on currency (e.g., JPY doesn't use decimal places).
### Details:
<info added on 2025-08-30T17:04:21.580Z>
Successfully implemented comprehensive currency-specific validation:

1. **Enhanced Validation Logic**:
   - Added currency-specific validation messages for JPY and KRW
   - Implemented validation that checks for decimal places based on currency
   - Added real-time validation that triggers when currency changes

2. **Currency-Specific Error Messages**:
   - JPY: "Japanese Yen uses whole numbers only (no decimal places)"
   - KRW: "Korean Won uses whole numbers only (no decimal places)"
   - Generic message for other currencies that don't use decimal places

3. **Real-Time Validation**:
   - Validation now includes selectedCurrency in LaunchedEffect dependencies
   - Amount field formatting enforces currency-specific rules in real-time
   - Error messages appear immediately when invalid input is detected

4. **Comprehensive Validation Coverage**:
   - Validates amount format based on currency decimal places
   - Provides clear, user-friendly error messages
   - Maintains existing validation for required fields and numeric values

The expense form now provides comprehensive validation that adapts to the selected currency's specific formatting requirements.

## 5. Write UI tests for currency selection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Espresso tests to verify currency selection functionality, including pre-selection, changing currency, and proper formatting.
### Details:


## 6. Add Currency Dropdown to Expense Form Layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the expense form layout to include a currency selection dropdown using MaterialComponents Exposed Dropdown Menu.

## Implementation Summary:

### 1. Currency Selection Persistence During Configuration Changes ✅
- Currency selection is managed by StateFlow in AddExpenseViewModel, ensuring persistence across configuration changes
- The selectedCurrency StateFlow is properly initialized with the user's default currency from AuthManager
- Currency selection survives screen rotations and other configuration changes

### 2. Enhanced Currency Validation Before Saving ✅
- Updated save button logic to ensure currency is selected before allowing save operation
- Modified form validation to include currency selection as a required field
- Save button is now disabled when no currency is selected (enabled = isFormValid && selectedCurrency != null)
- Removed fallback to "USD" in favor of explicit currency validation

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling ✅
- Currency validation and error handling are already implemented in the ViewModel using CurrencyValidator and CurrencyErrorHandler
- Proper error messages are displayed for currency-related validation failures
- Currency usage tracking is implemented for analytics and sorting

### 4. Currency Selection Maintenance During Form Session ✅
- Currency selection is maintained throughout the form session via StateFlow
- Currency changes are properly tracked and validated
- Amount field formatting updates automatically when currency changes
- Currency selection persists until explicitly changed by the user

## Key Improvements Made:
1. **Enhanced Save Button Logic**: Now requires explicit currency selection before allowing save
2. **Improved Form Validation**: Currency selection is now part of form validation criteria
3. **Better User Experience**: Save button is disabled when currency is not selected, providing clear feedback

# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Reusable Currency Selection Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a reusable dropdown component for currency selection with search functionality and grouping by popularity.
# Details:
Develop a reusable currency selection component that can be used across the app. The component should include search functionality, grouping by popularity, and display currency code, symbol, and name.

Implementation details:
1. Create a custom view component that extends MaterialAutoCompleteTextView
2. Implement search functionality
3. Group currencies by popularity (Most Popular, All Currencies)
4. Show currency code, symbol, and name
5. Support programmatic selection and change listeners

Code example:
```kotlin
class CurrencySelectionView @JvmOverloads constructor(
    context: Context,
    attrs: AttributeSet? = null,
    defStyleAttr: Int = R.attr.autoCompleteTextViewStyle
) : MaterialAutoCompleteTextView(context, attrs, defStyleAttr) {
    
    private var currencies: List<Currency> = Currency.values().toList()
    private var onCurrencySelectedListener: ((Currency) -> Unit)? = null
    
    init {
        setAdapter(createAdapter())
        setOnItemClickListener { _, _, position, _ ->
            val currency = adapter.getItem(position) as Currency
            onCurrencySelectedListener?.invoke(currency)
        }
    }
    
    fun setOnCurrencySelectedListener(listener: (Currency) -> Unit) {
        onCurrencySelectedListener = listener
    }
    
    fun setCurrencies(currencies: List<Currency>) {
        this.currencies = currencies
        setAdapter(createAdapter())
    }
    
    fun setSelectedCurrency(currencyCode: String) {
        val currency = Currency.fromCode(currencyCode) ?: Currency.USD
        setText("${currency.code} - ${currency.symbol} - ${currency.name}", false)
    }
    
    private fun createAdapter(): ArrayAdapter<Currency> {
        // Create adapter with filtering and grouping
        // Implementation details...
    }
}
```

Use Material Components library for consistent styling. Implement proper keyboard navigation and accessibility support.

## 2. Implement currency adapter with grouping functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a custom adapter for the currency dropdown that supports grouping currencies by popularity
### Details:
Implement a custom ArrayAdapter subclass that groups currencies into 'Most Popular' and 'All Currencies' sections. Create a data structure to represent grouped currencies. Override getView() method to display currency code, symbol, and name in each item. Add section headers in the dropdown list. Implement logic to determine popular currencies based on usage data from CurrencyUsageTracker. Ensure proper item layout with appropriate styling for both regular items and section headers.
<info added on 2025-09-05T16:56:43.212Z>
Successfully implemented currency adapter with grouping functionality:

**Completed Implementation:**
1. Created CurrencyDropdownItem sealed class to represent different item types:
   - CurrencyItem: Represents a selectable currency
   - SectionHeader: Represents a section header for grouping

2. Enhanced CurrencyAdapter with grouping capabilities:
   - Modified constructor to accept both currencies and popularCurrencies lists
   - Implemented createGroupedItems() method that creates sections:
     * "Most Popular" section with popular currencies
     * "All Currencies" section with remaining currencies
   - Added support for different view types (section headers vs currency items)
   - Implemented getItemViewType() and getViewTypeCount() for proper view recycling

3. Created section header layout (item_currency_section_header.xml):
   - Uses Material Design styling with primary color
   - Proper padding and typography for section headers
   - Background color for visual separation

4. Enhanced filtering functionality:
   - When searching, shows "Search Results" section instead of grouped sections
   - Maintains proper filtering across currency code, symbol, and name
   - Preserves grouping structure when no search is active

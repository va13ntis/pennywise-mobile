# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive testing suite for all currency-related functionality.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive testing suite for all currency-related functionality. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests as specified in the PRD.

Implementation details:
1. Unit tests for all currency-related models and utilities
2. Integration tests for database operations and business logic
3. UI tests for all currency-related screens and components
4. Performance tests for currency operations
5. Accessibility tests

Use the following testing libraries:
- JUnit 5 (org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.10.0) for unit tests
- Mockito (org.mockito:mockito-core:5.6.0) for mocking
- Espresso (androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.5.1) for UI tests
- Room testing utilities for database tests
- Robolectric (org.robolectric:robolectric:4.10.3) for unit tests that require Android framework

Code example for a test class:
```kotlin
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)
class CurrencyFeatureTest {
    @get:Rule
    val activityRule = ActivityScenarioRule(MainActivity::class.java)
    
    @Test
    fun testDefaultCurrencyInRegistration() {
        // Navigate to registration
        onView(withId(R.id.registerButton)).perform(click())
        
        // Verify USD is pre-selected
        onView(withId(R.id.currencySelector))
            .check(matches(withText(containsString("USD"))))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun testChangingCurrencyInExpenseForm() {
        // Navigate to expense form
        // ...
        
        // Change currency
        onView(withId(R.id.currencySelector)).perform(click())
        onView(withText(containsString("EUR"))).perform(click())
        
        // Verify currency symbol updated
        onView(withId(R.id.amountInputLayout))
            .check(matches(hasTextInputLayoutPrefixText("€")))
    }
    
    // More tests...
}
```

Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on pull requests and merges.

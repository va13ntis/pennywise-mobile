# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Settings Screen for Default Currency
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a Default Currency section to the settings screen to allow users to change their default currency.
# Details:
Enhance the settings screen to include a Default Currency section that shows the current default currency and allows changing it. Show a confirmation dialog when changing the default currency.

Implementation details:
1. Add a new section to the settings screen
2. Display current default currency
3. Use the same currency dropdown as in other screens
4. Show confirmation dialog when changing currency
5. Update user preferences when confirmed

Code example for the confirmation dialog:
```kotlin
private fun showCurrencyChangeConfirmation(newCurrency: Currency) {
    MaterialAlertDialogBuilder(requireContext())
        .setTitle(R.string.change_default_currency)
        .setMessage(getString(R.string.change_default_currency_confirmation, newCurrency.code))
        .setPositiveButton(R.string.confirm) { _, _ ->
            viewModel.updateDefaultCurrency(newCurrency.code)
        }
        .setNegativeButton(R.string.cancel, null)
        .show()
}
```

Use PreferenceFragmentCompat from androidx.preference:preference:1.2.1 for consistent settings UI. Implement proper error handling and loading states during currency update.

# Test Strategy:
Write UI tests using Espresso to verify that:
1. Current default currency is displayed correctly
2. Currency dropdown works correctly
3. Confirmation dialog is shown when changing currency
4. User preferences are updated correctly when confirmed
5. Changes persist after app restart
6. Accessibility testing with TalkBack
7. Test with different currencies

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add Default Currency Section to Settings Screen [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the existing settings screen by adding a new section for Default Currency that displays the current default currency.
### Details:
Create a new PreferenceCategory titled 'Currency Settings' in the settings_preferences.xml file. Add a Preference item for default currency that shows the current default currency code as the summary. Implement a SettingsViewModel that retrieves the current default currency from UserPreferences. Update the SettingsFragment to observe this data and display it correctly. Ensure proper loading states are shown while fetching the current default currency.

Successfully implemented the Default Currency section in the Settings Screen with the following key components:

1. Added string resources to strings.xml for currency settings UI elements and user feedback messages.

2. Enhanced SettingsViewModel with comprehensive default currency functionality including state management, update methods, error handling, and integration with AuthManager and UserRepository.

3. Extended AuthManager with a new updateCurrentUser() method to maintain consistency between database and local state when user data changes.

4. Improved SettingsDataStore with individual getter methods for theme, language, currency, and currency conversion settings.

5. Completely rewrote the SettingsScreen with a new Default Currency section featuring current currency display, loading states, error handling, currency selection dropdown, and user feedback for updates.

The implementation provides a complete default currency management system with proper error handling and user feedback, fulfilling all task requirements.

## 2. Implement Currency Selection Dropdown in Settings [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Add a dropdown menu to the Default Currency section that allows users to select from available currencies.
### Details:
Replace the simple Preference with a ListPreference or custom preference that shows a dropdown of available currencies. Reuse the existing currency dropdown component if available (from Task 12) or implement a simpler version. Populate the dropdown with currency data from the CurrencyRepository. Format each item to show currency code, symbol, and name. Ensure the current default currency is pre-selected in the dropdown.

Successfully implemented the Currency Selection Dropdown component with improved UI/UX by replacing the LazyColumn inside DropdownMenu with an AlertDialog for better user experience. Added RadioButton selection indicators and proper visual feedback for the selected currency. Enhanced the layout using Column with verticalScroll for better handling of the currency list. Implemented proper state management for dialog expansion/collapse and added accessibility features including content descriptions and dialog properties. Fixed potential issues with the previous implementation, added dividers between currency options for visual separation, and applied Material3 styling. The component now shows the current selected currency in the trigger button, displays available currencies sorted by popularity, provides clear visual feedback, handles dialog state management properly, and integrates seamlessly with the SettingsScreen.

## 3. Create Confirmation Dialog for Currency Change [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement a confirmation dialog that appears when a user selects a new default currency, warning about the implications of changing the default currency.
### Details:
Implement the showCurrencyChangeConfirmation method as provided in the example code. Hook this dialog to trigger when a new currency is selected from the dropdown. Ensure the dialog clearly shows which currency the user is changing to. Add appropriate string resources for the dialog title and message. Handle dialog dismissal appropriately, reverting the selection in the dropdown if the user cancels.
<info added on 2025-08-31T17:18:16.352Z>
Successfully implemented the Currency Change Confirmation Dialog with the following features:

Created CurrencyChangeConfirmationDialog Component that shows a confirmation message when users try to change their default currency. Added the 'change' string resource to strings.xml for the confirmation button. Integrated proper state management with showConfirmationDialog and pendingCurrencyChange variables to handle dialog visibility and state.

The dialog displays both current and new currency information with proper formatting using Material3 styling. Implemented handleCurrencySelection function that triggers the confirmation dialog when currency changes, along with handleConfirmation and handleDismiss functions for proper dialog interaction.

The user flow now works as follows:
1. User selects a new currency from the dropdown
2. Confirmation dialog appears showing current and new currency information
3. User can confirm or cancel the change
4. On confirmation, the currency is updated via ViewModel
5. On cancellation, the dialog closes without making changes

The confirmation dialog provides a clear warning about the impact of changing the default currency, ensuring users don't accidentally change their currency preference.

## 4. Implement Default Currency Update Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Develop the business logic to update the user's default currency preference when confirmed and handle any related data updates.
### Details:
In the SettingsViewModel, implement updateDefaultCurrency(currencyCode) method that updates the default currency in UserPreferences. Add proper error handling for cases where the currency update fails. Implement loading state management during the update process. Consider any other parts of the app that might need to be notified of this change (e.g., via LiveData or Flow). Ensure the update is performed on the appropriate coroutine dispatcher.
<info added on 2025-08-31T17:18:51.557Z>
Based on the comprehensive error handling and user feedback already implemented in the Settings Screen, this subtask should focus on integrating with the existing implementation rather than duplicating efforts. The updateDefaultCurrency method should leverage the established state management system and ensure proper coordination with other app components.

The method should utilize the existing DefaultCurrencyState and CurrencyUpdateState classes, properly transition between states, and ensure notifications to other parts of the app when currency changes occur. Implementation should respect the established patterns for authentication validation, exception handling, and state transitions while focusing on the core business logic of updating the currency preference.

## 5. Add UI Feedback and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Implement UI feedback for successful currency changes and proper error handling for failed updates.
### Details:
Add a success message (Snackbar or Toast) that appears when the default currency is successfully updated. Implement error handling to show appropriate error messages when currency update fails. Add loading indicators during the update process. Ensure the UI is updated to reflect the new default currency immediately after a successful update. Handle edge cases such as network errors or invalid currency selections. Update the settings screen summary to show the new default currency after change.
<info added on 2025-08-31T17:19:50.479Z>
The UI feedback implementation for currency changes is complete in SettingsScreen.kt with the following components:

1. Visual feedback through:
   - CircularProgressIndicator with "Loading..." text during updates
   - Green checkmark icon with "Default currency updated successfully" message for success
   - Red error icon with specific error messages for failures

2. Implementation uses:
   - currencyUpdateState from SettingsViewModel to track status
   - Inline feedback within the currency settings card
   - Automatic state reset via LaunchedEffect
   - Material3 design components with appropriate color coding
   - Properly defined string resources in strings.xml

3. State management through:
   - CurrencyUpdateState sealed class (Idle, Loading, Success, Error)
   - Automatic state reset after feedback display
   - Error message propagation from ViewModel to UI

The implementation follows Material Design guidelines and includes proper accessibility support.

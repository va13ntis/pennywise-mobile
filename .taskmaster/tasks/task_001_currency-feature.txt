# Task ID: 1
# Title: Update User Data Model with Default Currency
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the User entity to include the defaultCurrency field with USD as the default value.
# Details:
Modify the User data class to include the defaultCurrency field as specified in the PRD. Ensure backward compatibility by setting 'USD' as the default value. Use Kotlin data class with proper nullability handling. Implementation should follow the Repository pattern to maintain separation of concerns.

Code example:
```kotlin
data class User(
    val id: Long = 0,
    val username: String,
    val passwordHash: String,
    val email: String? = null,
    val defaultCurrency: String = "USD", // New field
    val createdAt: Date = Date(),
    val updatedAt: Date = Date()
)
```

Consider using Room database with TypeConverters for Date fields. For Room version, use the latest stable version (currently 2.6.0).

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify that:
1. New User objects have 'USD' as the default currency when not specified
2. User objects can be created with a specific currency
3. User objects can be serialized and deserialized correctly with the new field
4. Repository methods correctly handle the new field in CRUD operations
